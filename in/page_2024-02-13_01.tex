\section{The Meta Section: Contents and Style}
\emph{Chronological ID:} \texttt{2024-02-13:01}

\emph{Structural ID:} \texttt{1.5.1}

Section \texttt{1} is designated as the ``meta'' section, discussing the Madelineverse as a work of fiction, the circumstances under which it arose, the various inspirations, the tools and maxims of development, etc. It has a number of stylistic differences from the sections following it:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The meta section is the only section allowed to ``break the fourth wall'' and directly address the author as an entity, years of development in real life, etc. Even then, it must be careful not to use any pronouns for the author.
  \item The meta section is the only section allowed to directly address other content, whether fictional or educational, existing on the Earth, and how its existence affects the Madelineverse. Even then, certain content, such as precursors to the Madelineverse, must remain unnamed, and its authors, other than the author of the Madelineverse, must remain unidentified.
  \item The meta section is the only section without a strict order. The sub-sections may be read in any order, or skipped entirely, if the reader so chooses.
\end{itemize}

The sub-sections of the meta section currently are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{1.1}: summaries and maxims that affect the project as a whole
  \item \texttt{1.2}: an insight into the integration of computer-based tools into development, with special attention given to AI-based tools
  \item \texttt{1.3}: an insight into the decision-making
  \item \texttt{1.4}: a formal description of how numbers and other hard data must be presented
  \item \texttt{1.5}: summaries and maxims that only affect one section
\end{itemize}

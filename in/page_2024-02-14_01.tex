\begin{itemize}
  \item On the *Earth, local maps are typically produced with the direction towards the sub-lunar point being ``up''. Continental maps, which actually show a significant portion of land around the sub-lunar point, do not have a set orientation.
  \item \emph{Additional facts are to be presented once there's any one of a modern map, a culture, or a language to work off of.}

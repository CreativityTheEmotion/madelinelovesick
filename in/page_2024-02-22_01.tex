Section \texttt{2} is designated for the broad sciences of geophysics and astrophysics. It describes the various objects both within and without the planetary system, for the most part, ignoring the lifeforms present on any planetary body and their cultures, though how the *Earth's residents perceive certain objects and integrate them into their own culture is inevitably mentioned.

Of all the sections of this treatise, this section is easily the most grounded in hard data and numbers. As such, it is most reliant on external software to make some of the computations of the numbers in question, including but not limited to SpaceEngine, Universe Sandbox and Artifexian's WorldSmith. However, explorations more trending towards art, such as mapmaking, are also partaken in, and also use software, such as GPlates for the simulation of plate tectonics.

The sub-sections of the geophysics section currently are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{2.1}: the *Sun
  \item \texttt{2.2} through \texttt{2.8}: the planets orbiting the *Sun, namely the *Earth and *Gas Giants 1 through 6
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Within \texttt{2.2} through \texttt{2.8}, adding a \texttt{.1} creates a section designated to a planet's moons; for example, \texttt{2.2.1} is a section all about the *Moon
    \item \texttt{2.2.2}: plate tectonics on the *Earth
  \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{2.9}: the minor planets of the planetary system
  \item \texttt{2.10}: historiography of the planetary system
  \item \texttt{2.11}: objects outside the planetary system, such as galaxies and stars
\end{itemize}
